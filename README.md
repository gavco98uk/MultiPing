MultiPing is a networking tool I wrote around 10 years ago. I found I was always constantly searching the network trying to find a spare IP address, so I wrote a tool to do the scanning for me.

With multiping, you specify an IP address block - e.g 192.168.0.x. MultiPing will then ping all IP addresses from 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.255, showing the results in a handy graphical interface, allowing you to easily see which addresses are free.

It's also handy for trying to locate devices on networks quickly.

I have now open sourced this so others may also benefit from this.
